                Ada Lovelace, born in 1815, was a British mathematician and writer. She is recognized as the first computer programmer due to her work on the Analytical Engine, an early mechanical computer. Lovelace's notes on the machine include what is recognized as the first algorithm intended to be carried out by a machine. She is considered by many as a visionary who predicted the ability of computers to go beyond mere number-crunching.
